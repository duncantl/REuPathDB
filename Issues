This is a collection of issues I came across when building the
interface and testing it, both manually and programmatically.

The name = POST is incorrect

The path/URL is wrong

AssembliesByLocation is incomplete.
EstsByLocation.wadl  also
GenesByExtraerythrocyticExpression.wadl
GenesByIntraerythrocyticExpression.wadl
GenesByTimeSeriesFoldChangeBradyFl.wadl

  The .*Questions.wadl files are correct.


The response mentions 2 types, but not which is 
for which method. And the Content-Type returned from
JSON is text/plain not text/json or application/json.
