Package: REuPathDB
Version: 1.0-0
Depends: XML, RJSONIO, RCurl, WADL
Title: Interface to REST API of (EuPathDB)
Description: This package provides an interface to the 
  Web Services of Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Resources (EuPathDB).
  The code is mostly programmatically generated by reading the WADL
  files describing the different methods and resources.
  Version 1.0-0 differs from the first version by collapsing the
  XML and JSON versions of each method into a single function
  and allows the caller to specify which version to use.
  The JSON version is the default for each method.
  The code is created by the generate2.R script in this directory
  and version 0.2-0 or higher of the WADL package.
